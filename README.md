# Gym Program Reader
Flutter project made to learn the Flutter environment.
At the moment it's able to read gym programs in this format froma '.txt' file:
```
DAY A
Series Exercise_Name
Series Exercise_Name
Series Exercise_Name

DAY B
Series Exercise_Name
Series Exercise_Name
Series Exercise_Name

DAY C
Series Exercise_Name
Series Exercise_Name
Series Exercise_Name

...
```
Willing to add a smart way to understand different-written gym programs.
Made this project to try and learn some Flutter and Dart, while simultaneously applying MVMM pattern, in order to understand it and how to apply it.
Other than this, I got also to play around with animations (the timer animation).

### Some screenshots from the application:
